# Maximize-Revenue-Generation for Cab-drivers

## Problem Statement
In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, making the most of
revenue is essential for long-term success and driver
happiness.
goal is to use data-driven insights to maximise
revenue streams for taxi drivers in order to meet this need.
research aims to determine whether payment
methods have an impact on fare pricing by focusing on the
relationship between payment type and fare amount

## Research Question
**Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type?**

## Journey Insights
Customers paying with cards tend to have a slightly higher average trip distance and fare amount
compared to those paying with cash.
Indicates that customers prefers to pay more with cards when they have high fare amount and
long trip distance.

## Preference of Payment Types
The proportion of customers paying with cards is
significantly higher than those paying with cash,
with card payments accounting for 67.5% of all
transactions compared to cash payments at
32.5%.
This indicates a strong preference among
customers for using card payments over cash,
potentially due to convenience, security, or
incentives offered for card transactions.

## Passenger Count Analysis
Among card payments, rides with a single passenger (passenger_count = 1) comprise the largest proportion,
constituting 40.08% of all card transactions.
Similarly, cash payments are predominantly associated with single-passenger rides, making up 20.04% of all
cash transactions.
There is a noticeable decrease in the percentage of transactions as the passenger count increases, suggesting
that larger groups are less likely to use taxis or may opt for alternative payment methods.
These insights emphasize the importance of considering both payment method and passenger count when
analyzing transaction data, as they provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.

## Hypothesis Testing
**Null hypothesis:** There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards
and customers who use cash.
**Alternative hypothesis:** There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit
cards and customers who use cash
With a T-statistic of 165.5 and a P-value of less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting
that there is indeed a significant difference in average fare between the two payment methods.
